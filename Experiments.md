* p.g. 331, exercise12
* RBD

### Popcornâ€“Microwave Experiment 
* An example on p.g. 205, every step of experiment is nicely laid out
* factorial
* might be a bit too complicated

### Soap
* p.g. 22
* Again, an example with each step nicely laid out
* RBD

### Algorithm
* Fairly simple, not in the book but found something similar here
* https://github.com/jabbalaci/SpeedTests?tab=readme-ov-file
* data not available but algorithm is easy to implement
* can also run experiments automatically
